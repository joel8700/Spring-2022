# Spring-2022
1. Real Estate Data Analysis
2. Project Objective
	- Problem: Which city in L.A. County should a Real Estate Company expand their residential housing business into?
	- Solution: Web scrape data from popular real estate site Redfin, and get data by zip code.
		    Collect data like the sale price, median days on market, etc.
3. Job Description
	Position: Sales Data Analyst for Clever, a Real Estate firm. I chose this because I am interested
		in the real estate market, and have thought about buying/managing properties as a way 
		of generating passive income or as a part of my retirement strategy.
		This position involves analyzing Real Estate data to make business insights and 
		make strategic decisions for real estate companies on where a housing market may be worth
		investing into. 
	Relevancy to the Project: This project is related to the job posting in that much of the job 
		activities involve this type of activity. I will be able to make real estate insights
		and provide reccomendations about expansion relating to the real estate market.
4. Data
	Source: Redfin for housing-related data, zip-codes.com to see which city every zip code is in
	Characteristics: Mostly quantitative data that can be compared and aggregated. The data relating
	to cities and counties for each zip code would be considered qualitative.

6. Future Improvements
	There are some zipcodes that I was not able to scrape in L.A. county. Additionally, 
	the scraper did not get data from certain zip codes in the loop even though Redfin has the 
	data for it, so I would have liked to fix that. If I had more time, I also would have 
	filtered my analysis more to cities with more than 3 or 4 zipcodes to them, to get a 
	better representation of the real estate market for every city in L.A. county. 
	Finally, it would have been nice to expand my search to all zip codes in California, or even 
	ones in other states.
